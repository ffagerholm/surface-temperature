    <h1>Comparison of the rise in temperature globally versus in the northern hemisphere</h1>
    <p>
        The plot shows the monthly observations of temperature anomalies (in &#176C), that is, deviations from the 
        mean temperature per month from the reference period 1951-1980. The limits of the x-axis are set as 2015 to 2020
        by default, but the plot contains data from 1880 to the present. You may use the plot controls in the 
        upper right corner to alter the view of the data, e.g. press autoscale see all of the data and reset 
        axes to go back to the default view.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data has been obtained from the <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/">NASA GISTEMP v3 pages</a> 
        (data sets: Land-Ocean Temperature Index <em>Global-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means</em> and 
        <em>Northern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The plot also contains a one year forecast that has been generated using a SARIMA model trained on the 
        historical data (1880-01-01 to 2019-02-01). The forecasted mean values are shown together with their 
        95%-confidence intervals (shaded areas). A SARIMA model was chosen due to the nature of the data, 
        being a time-series with seasonal variation which the model can take into account. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The models that fit each time-series best were chosen through gridsearch. Different configurations 
        of the hyperparameters were evaluated through cross-validation, and the models with the lowest 
        mean squared error were chosen.
